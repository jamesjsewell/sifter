# Sifter

Sifter is an application produced by a small team of five developers. We aimed to make an aptitude test for remote controllers disguised as a game. Research has suggested that gamifying the learning process can help make material more enjoyable and also cause a deeper level of understanding. 

This app is written in Javascript and is therefore compatible with all modern web browsers. We have written the code to be lightweight so it can can be quickly and easily adapted to work with smaller devices such as tablets and mobile screens.

When you use game-based assessments as part of your recruitment process, you’re not only identifying the best candidates quickly, accurately, and enjoyably. You’re also telling your prospective employees that you’re an innovative employer and that you care about the experience your candidates go through to become a part of your team. Candidates become immersed in the games and forget they’re completing an assessment, which means they’re less stressed, providing you with more authentic data about their performance.

While playing Sifter, the user will be tested in multiple ways. Sifter tests reaction time. It tests the user’s ability to think spatially while under pressure. It tests solving intense problems while multitasking. Most importantly, it tests overall cognitive ability and contains specific components to enhance mental agility and attention span. 

The abilities measured by Sifter are critical for almost every role, from entry-level to executive. We feel that Sifter can be a valuable tool for not only finding the right candidate for a particular job, but also for furthering training for employees of any skill level.
